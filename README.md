# Foundations, A BadKraftMC Production

This is *Foundations*, a Mod for Minecraft Java v. 1.18.2.

If you have made it here, that means you've been looking for something new. *Foundations* is just that. This Mod is about re-imagining how we play the game - from start to finish. What does that mean? Well, it means take everything you've known about getting started and toss it. Imagine not having wooden, or stone tools. Imagine not having the Stone Furnace to start with. You're not mining any stone for a bit. Your first home will likely be a dirt hole on the side of a river.  
  
*Foundations* makes heavy use of gravel, clay, and sand as early necessities. Most everything you'll need to start, you'll find by a river. Gravel drops flint, of course, which is the material needed for the primitive tools - axe and shovel. There is no early version of a sword. So you'll have to equip yourself with a flint knife.  

Clay has a couple of drops - clay ball and clay ore ball. The clay ball is a vanilla item that is used to bake into bricks and, later, the primary resource for better constuction materials. **Clay Ore** can be smelted into an iron ore nugget. Gravel drops are modified to occasionally drop one of the following: 1 coal, 1 clay ore, 1 iron ore nugget, and, of course, a gravel or a flint.  

Learn to use a campfire for cooking. Once you have baked some clay into clay bricks, you can craft the **Clay Oven**. It acts as a campfire when you click food items on the top face of the block. *[TBA]* Click on the other facings to open up the familiar furnace inventory UI.  

This is only the beginning. There is a lot planned for *Foundations*. There will be new blocks, walls, brick formats for vanilla blocks, polished blocks, etc.
We are currently testing with the following mods (which you can find in the mods folder along with *Foundations*):  
1. [dynamiclightsreforged-1.18.2_v1.3.3](https://beta.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamiclights-reforged/files/3817266)
2. [jei-1.18.2-9.7.0.195](https://beta.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei/files/3940240)
3. [rubidium_extras-1.18.2_v1.3.2](https://beta.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/magnesium-extras/files/3936081)
4. [rubidium-0.5.4](https://beta.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rubidium/files/4024781)
5. [starlight-1.0.2+forge.546ae87](https://beta.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/starlight-forge/files/3706539)

We are focused on getting *Foundations* equipped with all the bells and whistles. Therefore, we are not going to keep updating the version to the newest minor Minecraft releases. If we did that, then we would never be able to add new value to the Mod. It is our goal, first and foremost, to deliver a quality Mod with quality experience for the players. We will determine if new Minecraft releases are substantive enough to make the effort to bring *Foundations* to the release. The longer a particular version of Minecraft remains popular and is substantive, the more likely it is you will see a *Foundations* release. There are example landmark versions that are still popular today - 1.7.x, 1.12.x, 1.16.x. We feel that 1.18.2 is one of those.  

Although *Foundations* is still in very early stages, it is usable. Until the **Clay Oven** (to be completed soon) has smelting capability, you'll have to cheat and give yourself a stone furnace. But you will be able to go from flint tools to iron tools. It just takes time because you're still going to have to find enough nuggets to make the iron tools. Once the smelting functionality is completed, *Foundations* will be on [CurseForge](https://beta.curseforge.com).  

We will keep this page updated as new things are added. We are also open to suggestions; in fact, we want your suggestions. What would you like to see in a mod. If it adds value to *Foundations*, you will see it and get credit listing for the idea.  

Thank you for taking the time to read this introduction.  

Sincerely,  
The *Foundations* Dev Team
